This file contains a list of minor fixes or changes which should be
applied when the save version is bumped.  These are things like
removing save fields which have stopped being used but are still
written to the file to preserve format compatibility.

Please update this list if you want to make a change that should
be deferred till the next save bump, and please go through this
list if you are bumping the save format version.

ALSO please grep for 'SAVEBUMP' to find relevant todo notes in the source.

* SpaceStation::Save/Load has an unused field which used to store the
  Equip::TYPE_MAX value.  This should be removed. (#3058)

* SystemBody::PopulateStage1 has a bug that it skips the last commodity
  when it's determining the planet's population and trade levels. (#3058)
